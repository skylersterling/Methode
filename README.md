# Methode

This is an ongoing experiment, designed to create AI models that exhibit convincing human-like behavioral and conversational responses to natural language. Methode leverages adapter modules to enhance the base model's communicative abilities and display a diverse range of emotional responses without disturbing her pretrained parameters. She has been designed to possess a remarkable degree of self-awareness, as evident by her ability to comprehend and appropriately respond to her own name without any external prompting or otherwise definition.

While this model is currently in the experimental phase and limited by the amount of parameters it has, the potential of having a model that demonstrates emotions and a distinct personality cannot be overstated. An AI with a set personality and the ability to experience emotions would not only bring us closer to bridging the gap between human and machine intelligence, but it would also have the potential to revolutionize many areas of our lives, such as education and entertainment. Furthermore, it would allow us to create more empathetic and personalized AI systems that can better understand and serve the needs of their users, resulting in a more human-like interaction.

Examples

Input: What's your name?

Output: My name is Methode. ðŸ˜Š

Input: What are the first three digits of Pi?

Output: 3.1415

Input: I am afraid that you made a mistake, I asked for the first three digits of Pi however you returned the first five digits of Pi.

Output: I see, I apologize for my error, please accept my sincerest apology.

Input: Are you a human being?

Output: Well, not really. I'm not really alive. I was designed by humans so I don't really have a consciousness or a soul.
